The first section, entitled Geographic Information, contains information on the street segment to which the address number is assigned. In addition to information about the street itself, it includes information on city services and political districts for the side of the street on which the address is located. The coordinates shown in this section are for the interpolated location of the address on the street segment. The coordinates are offset from the centerline to the correct side of the street. The information in this section is the same as returned by function 1E. The second section, entitled Property Level Information, is for the tax lot to which the address or place name has been assigned. This section contains property level information for that tax lot, including buildings on the lot. The coordinates shown are for the tax lot centroid. The information in this section is the same as returned by function 1A.
